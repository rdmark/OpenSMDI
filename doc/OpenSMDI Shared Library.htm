      face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size=-1>What is OpenSMDI ?<BR><BR>If 
      you're an electronic musician and use a digital sound sampler, you 
      probably know that you can transfer your samples directly from your 
      computer to your sampler and back through an SCSI interface. When I first 
      got a sampler, I of course wanted to benefit from the immense speed 
      advantage compared with normal floppy disks. But I found out very fast 
      that there are very few programs which can do such SCSI transfers, and the 
      few which can are mostly very huge "virtual studio" software packages 
      which can do 1000 more things beside that and which are of course very 
      expensive.<BR><BR>It happened that I didn't want to spend so much money 
      just for this one functionality. So I decided to develop a program for it 
      on my own. The only thing I needed was the specification of the SMDI 
      protocol. Fine, but where can you find that ? I tried several search 
      machines in the Internet, including deja.com, but didn't have any success. 
      Finally I got it from Jay Vaughan of <A 
      href="http://www.teklab.com/">Teklab</A> and I wrote an SMDI transfer tool 
      for myself. After some time I started to extract all the SMDI functions 
      from the program code into a separate library which I later ported to 
      Linux. OpenSMDI was born.<BR><BR>So, the whole SMDI transfer "standard" 
      among samplers is absolutely annoying, because the protocol specs are<BR>
      <UL>
        <LI>pretty hard to obtain 
        <LI>quite buggy and inconsistent 
        <LI>published in a <A 
        href="http://home.t-online.de/home/chrisnowak/opensmdi/smdi.pdf">PDF 
        document</A> as a "preliminary copy" 
        <LI>therefore hard to implement in an application </LI></UL><BR>which is 
      probably the reason why there are only few, expensive applications which 
      support it. It is far too hard to implement in a program. OpenSMDI has the 
      goal to change that situation by providing an easy to use, consistent, 
      multi-platform, open source library implementation of the SMDI protocol, 
      in the hope that it will encourage more programmers out there to offer 
      SMDI functionality in their audio applications - programmers who are 
      scared by all the ASPI (SCSI) and SMDI programming hassle.<BR><BR>Keep 
      making those great audio applications !<BR><BR><BR>- Chris Nowak, <A
