These things need to be done, some more urgent than others:

  - Delphi example that links with smdi.dll
  - Maybe(!) a Windows C example program with a GUI (this is actually done 
    by me, it just needs to be changed to use smdi.dll instead of its own 
    built-in functions)
  - Error checking after calls of "malloc" in smdi.c
    (This is a known bug. There will be segment violations when no memory 
    could be allocated)
  - More example code in smdi.html
  - (*) Proof reading of smdi.html
  - Integration of SoX (maybe), OR optionally built-in support for 
    more file formats
  - (*) Tests with as many samplers as possible (needs smdixfer to be finished)
  - MIDI sample dump through SCSI for Akai samplers (Jon a.k.a. earache??)
  - Ports to BeOS, Unix and MacOS (not urgent)
  - Under some circumstances the current handling of the .dwStructSize 
    member of the structures will cause a segment violation (this is a 
    known bug)
  - (*) Upload the library to sites like simtel.net
  - Optional access to generic SCSI device drivers other than 
    "/dev/sg[a...]" under Linux, maybe with a new function call (silly) 
    or a new #define in the source (better)
  - (*) A proper "Powered by OpenSMDI" button :-) maybe more than one
  - (*) A well-designed+informative standard HTML 3.2 or 4.0 web presence

(*) These things can be done by non-programmers
